Programs that're configured here:

- [i3blocks][i3blocks]
- [st][st]
- [nvim][nvim]

Programs configs depend on:
- Some dmenu scripts I have in [.local/bin](/.local/bin).
  The `dmenu_pass` script in here isn't the
  one from dmenu's official scripts section.
- [bemoji][bemoji]
- And [boomer][boomer].
  Allows you to zoom into and highlight something.
